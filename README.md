# Hello, folks! :girl: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
My name is Sin Yee and I am from Malaysia. I am a data science graduate from Monash University who is passionate in data processing, predictive analytics, and machine learning. I am excited in the ways data can be used to shape our future. 


# [Project 1: Narrative Visualisation Project - Link between Fertility Rate and Income](https://github.com/sinyeen/Fertility_Income_Visualisation.git) :baby:
This shiny application is designed to interactively visualise the relationship between income and fertility based on the collected data which are wrangled and presented in the `Data Table` Tab. The main question for the visualization project is “Why is fertility rate higher in poor countries?”, and the sub-questions of it are “How education, child mortality rate, and social security system affect the fertility rates?” and “How gross domestic product (GDP) plays a role in the distribution of these three factors?”

# [Project 2: Data Processing for Big Data: Pedestrain Traffic Prediction](https://github.com/sinyeen/Pedestrain_Traffic_Prediction_BigData.git) :vertical_traffic_light:
Develop machine learning models to predict the pedestrian traffic in the City of Melbourne. The machine learning models would be further integrated into the streaming platform using `Apache Kafka` and `Apache Spark` Streaming to perform prediction. The aim of this project is to build models for predicting whether the potential count would go above the threshold of 2000 and also predicting the possible count.

| Use Case | Description | Model |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| 1 | Predict whether count would go above 2000 for the hours **between 9:00am and midnight** | Binary classification|
| 2 | Predict the possible count for the hours **between 9:00am and midnight** | Regression |
